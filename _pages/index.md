The Cava laboratory is a research group in the [Computational Health Informatics Program](http://www.chip.org) at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

We are interested in improving the _interpretability_ and _fairness_ of predictive models deployed in healthcare settings.
We create and study algorithms that can embed these notions when working with health data.
