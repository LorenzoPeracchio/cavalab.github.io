Our research focuses on developing multi-objective learning methods and using them to explain the principles underlying complex, biomedical processes.
We use these methods to learn predictive models from electronic health records (EHRs) that are both *interpretable* to clinicians and *fair* to the population on which they are deployed. 
Our long-term goals are to positively impact human health by developing methods that are flexible enough to automate entire computational workflows underlying scientific discovery and medicine.
