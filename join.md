We are a multi-disciplinary group, open to students in clinical and biomedical sciences, computer science, statistics, engineering, and related fields. 
We seek clarity and fairness from complex problems that necessitate interdisciplinary approaches. 
Our goals are to cultivate an environment for critical thinking, research creativity and open scientific collaboration. 
In addition, this lab is a good fit for those who wish to gain expertise in biomedical informatics and machine learning, especially when interpretability and fairness are central concerns. 

Check out the opportunities below to get involved with the lab.
