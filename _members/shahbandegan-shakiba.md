Shakiba is a PhD student in "Computer Science" and "Ecology, Evolution and Behavior" at Michigan State University. 
Her research is mainly focused on exploring techniques that can help advance evolutionary computation such as development of predictive theories that can facilitate the selection of suitable algorithms for specific problems, as well as development of new and sophisticated algorithms. 
She is interested in employing these techniques in machine learning and artificial intelligence and their potential applications in engineering. 
She is doing an internship at the Cava Lab where she is excited to apply her previous research experience to practical work.
