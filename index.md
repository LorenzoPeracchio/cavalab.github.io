Welcome to the Clarity- And Virtue-driven Algorithms Laboratory. 
We are interested in improving the _interpretability_ and _fairness_ of predictive models deployed in healthcare settings.
We create and study algorithms that can embed these notions when learning from health data.

The Cava laboratory is part of the [Computational Health Informatics Program](http://www.chip.org) at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

### Join the Team!

We're new, and growing. 
If you're excited to do a post-doc or graduate studies at the intersection of interpretability, fairness, and health informatics, please contact {{ site.email }}.
